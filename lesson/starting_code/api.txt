This is a list of messages the GUI understands.

Format:
ClassOfMessage: description of what will happen when message is received.


Point: GUI draws that point if it is in the current view

Iterable[Point]: Same as sending each point sequentially

Bound: GUI updates its view to that bound, discarding all drawn points.

the String "getBound": GUI responds with the bound it is currently looking
	at. Note that you can use !? instead of ! to send a message and wait for a
	response.

the String "subscribe": Subscribes the sender to bound updates. Whenever
	the GUI's view area is changed, the sender will be sent the new Bound
	object as it it had just sent "getBound".


In addition, the GUI responds to keystrokes to move the viewing area:
	arrow keys: pan the view
	i: zoom in
	o: zoom out

	Note that when the viewing area is moved, the GUI does not redraw any
	old points that are still in view.
